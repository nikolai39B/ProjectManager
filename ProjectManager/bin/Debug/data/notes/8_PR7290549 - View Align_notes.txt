Iyanna thinks that this behavior might be intended. However, the 'Hinge' option is missing from the View

DrawingUI_UICompViewPlacement.cxx @ lines 1794 - 1804 look relevant to this toggle being disabled.

Testing this theory...
Yes this seems to be the cause. Also, @ lines 1722 - 1726 is where it gets disabled by default.
