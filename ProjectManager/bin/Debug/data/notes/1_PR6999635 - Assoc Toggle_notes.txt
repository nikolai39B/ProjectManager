D:\Scratch\basic_parts\block.prt

Steps to reproduce:
1.	Open NX
2.	Open block.prt
3.	Create new sheet
4.	Base View -> Settings -> Settings -> Common -> Configuration -> turn Snapshot on
5.	OK -> Place the view
6.	Projected View dialog -> Hinge Line -> Associative sensitive (should not be)

DrawingUI_UICompHingeLine.cxx dialog_post_constructor() is probably relevant (@ line 164)

DrawingUI_UICompEditViewSettings.cxx is also probably relevant.

Put a watch for ((viewStyleData).prefs).snapshot_toggle_data
	Put a BP @ line 1119 of DrawingUI_UICompEditViewSettings.cxx
	
Need to figure out a way to query the view settings given its tag
	Perhaps look at CP NX334976 for ideas for this.

VIEW_ask_snapshot_view(), which lives in view_draft_access.c, might do what I want here.
	Yup, this totally seems to work.

Iyanna said to go ahead and put it on a CP, but wait for him to talk to Kirk about it.
The CP is NX375839.

Iyanna stopped by to comment on it and try a related case.

Also, there seems to be a bug where even if the projected view is not marked associative, it still
goes out of date / changes when updated if the parent view is rotated.

CP submit and PR closed FN.
